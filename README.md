# kss2-jank-homeswitches

## Some super basic homeWorldName based homeswitches for Kerbal-Star-Systems 2, mostly made for myself

Find the homeswitch.zip under releases, unzip it inside KSS2 gameData folder
Then add a line to KSS2Settings.cfg 'homeSwitch = name' where name is the name of the planet, or False to disable

## Regarding the camera displacement / black screen / glitchy texture bug
The camera displacement bug found when you switch back to the space center scene from a different one is not solvable, atleast I do not know how. 
A quicksave and quickload from an active vessel scene fixes this temporarily it seems.

## Currently supported: 
Alva
Thats it. Literally thats it until I make alva's KSC not so sunk into the ground
